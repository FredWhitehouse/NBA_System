NBA Prediction System: Project Development Journal
Project Overview
This journal documents the development process of building an NBA game prediction system from scratch. The goal is to create a model that accurately predicts game outcomes, scores, and player performances based on historical NBA data. This document chronicles key decisions, challenges, technical insights, and learning moments throughout the project lifecycle.
Project Inception (March 2025)
Initial Project Planning
The project began with a clear vision: to build a prediction system that can generate daily forecasts for NBA games including win probabilities, projected scores, and player performance predictions. After researching available data sources, I decided to use the nba_api Python package to access official NBA statistics.
I drafted a comprehensive project plan with defined phases:

Data collection and cleaning
Exploratory data analysis
Feature engineering
Model development
System implementation and validation

Technical Environment Setup

Set up a GitHub repository for version control
Created a Python virtual environment with necessary dependencies
Established a structured project directory to organize code, data, and documentation
Implemented a systematic documentation approach including data dictionaries and process documentation

Data Collection Phase
Initial Data Collection (March 15, 2025)
Successfully implemented scripts to collect basic NBA team information and game data. The initial approach focused on:

Getting basic team information including names, abbreviations, and cities
Collecting game results from 2017-18 through 2023-24 seasons
Standardizing team names for consistency (e.g., "LA Lakers" vs. "Los Angeles Lakers")

Technical Challenge: Needed to join data from multiple NBA API endpoints to get comprehensive team information including conference affiliation.
Solution: Created a two-step data collection process that first gets basic team data and then enriches it with conference information from the league standings endpoint.
Data Completeness Issue (March 17, 2025)
Key Discovery: While analyzing team matchups, I noticed that a known playoff series between the Orlando Magic and Milwaukee Bucks from the 2019-20 season wasn't appearing in the dataset. Further investigation revealed that no playoff games at all were present in the dataset.
Root Cause Analysis: The issue was with the API call parameters. The leaguegamefinder endpoint was not returning playoff games with the default parameters because it requires explicitly specifying the season type.
Learning Moment: This highlighted the importance of validating data completeness against known events rather than simply assuming all data is being returned by the API.
Solution Implemented: Modified the data collection script to specifically request both regular season and playoff games by adding the season_type_nullable parameter with appropriate values. After several iterations testing different parameter combinations, I confirmed that both regular season and playoff games were being collected correctly.
Game Type Classification Insight (March 18, 2025)
Technical Discovery: Through careful examination of the data, I discovered that the NBA API encodes game types within the game ID structure. The first three digits of each game ID indicate the game type:

001: Preseason games
002: Regular season games
004: Playoff games
005: All-Star games

This insight greatly simplified the process of filtering and classifying games, allowing for more reliable data cleaning and preprocessing.
Data Cleaning Implementation (March 18, 2025)
Implemented a comprehensive data cleaning process to ensure data quality:

Team Filtering: Removed non-NBA teams and properly handled historical name changes
Game Type Filtering: Used the discovered game ID prefix system to include only regular season (002) and playoff (004) games
Data Quality Filtering: Removed anomalous records such as:

Games with zero points (likely data errors)
Exhibition and All-Star games (non-competitive contexts)
Preseason games (not representative of normal team performance)



Data Validation: Implemented a validation system to compare collected game counts against known season totals. The validation confirmed near-perfect coverage (99.8-100.4%) of games across all seasons.
Interesting Pattern Discovered: Approximately 3-4% of games have only one team's perspective recorded rather than both teams. This pattern is consistent across seasons and represents a normal variation in the NBA's data collection process.
Documentation Development
Data Dictionary Creation (March 19, 2025)
Created comprehensive data dictionaries for:

Team data fields
Game data fields
Game type classification

The dictionaries include not just field descriptions but also business context for why each data point matters for prediction purposes.
Data Cleaning Methodology Documentation
Documented all cleaning decisions with clear justification for each:

Why certain game types were excluded
How team names were standardized
Validation processes to ensure data completeness

This documentation ensures transparency and reproducibility of the data preparation process.
Current Status and Next Steps
Completion of Data Foundation (March 20, 2025)
The project now has a solid data foundation with:

Clean, validated game data spanning seven NBA seasons (2017-18 through 2023-24)
Complete coverage of both regular season and playoff games
Standardized team information with conference affiliation
Comprehensive documentation of data sources and preprocessing steps

Preparing for Data Analysis
The next phase will involve comprehensive exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns and relationships in the data:

Team performance patterns and trends
Home court advantage analysis
Impact of rest days and schedule
Regular season vs. playoff performance differences
Shot type and efficiency analysis
Momentum and streak effects
Matchup-specific dynamics

These analyses will inform the feature engineering process for the prediction models.
Reflections on Progress
The data collection and cleaning phase revealed several important insights for data science practice:

The importance of validating data completeness against known events
The value of understanding the underlying data structures (like the game ID encoding)
The necessity of thorough documentation throughout the process
The benefit of incremental development with validation at each step

These foundation-building steps, while time-consuming, are critical for creating a reliable prediction system. By ensuring data quality and completeness at this stage, the subsequent analysis and modeling phases will have a solid base to build upon.
